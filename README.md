# LSC_Prizes
I came across a similar idea somewhere and decided to create my own version. Every 45 minutes or anytime you set in the config.lua, a global message will appear with a math question. The first player to answer correctly wins a cash prize. It's a fun way for players to engage and earn some extra in-game money!
